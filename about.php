	<p style="font-size: 14px;color:#123456;text-align: justify;padding: 15px;">
		Junior store is a social media network primarily designed to help parents especially mothers keep a chronological archive of their newborns and young ones moving memories and events at their tender age, which their children can access them when they grow up. Currently mothers find it difficult in storing and organizing their young ones memories. Grown up children are always eager to know their toddle memories, how they looked like when they were born, when they started walking among many questions mothers are asked by their children. Junior store provides a solution to this.
<br/>Technology has provided a crucial tool not only in information storage but also in information processing. In the past mankind relied heaving on their mind power to store and remember information which proved cumbersome mothers found it difficult in storing and accurately remembering their children memories as result many children encountered hostility when they tried to ask their mothers where they came from and some of their childhood memories, fathers were more hostile to such questions or topics hence children never had an opportunity to know the truth.
<br/>With the internet in our hands, I utilized it in coming up with the junior store a web based project. Mothers can keep daily diaries of their children from anywhere at any time. Expectant mothers can also find friend on junior store where they can share information on parenting and help in raising healthy and responsible generations.
Childhood memories are awesome that everyone would ask for someone to tell them, junior store will.
